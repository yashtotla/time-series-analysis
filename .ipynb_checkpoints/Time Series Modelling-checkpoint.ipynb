    "# Time Series Overview\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Time series is a series of data points ordered in time. <br>\n",
    "When focused in time series data, the aim is to estimate how the sequence of observations will continue in the future.<br>\n",
    "Depending on source of generation, we can have various frequencies at which data is collected. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Major assumption in time series is that past pattern will continue in the future. <br>\n",
    "Examples\n",
    "- monthly sales data\n",
    "- quartely/annual revenue\n",
    "- hourly weather and wind speed data\n",
    "- IOT sensors and smart devices\n",
    "- energy forecasting\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Concepts\n",
    "1. Trends\n",
    "2. Seasonality\n",
    "3. Cyclic\n",
    "4. Statonary\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Trends\n",
    "long term increase or decrease in data <br>\n",
    "trend need not be linear <br>\n",
    "there can be changing direction <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Seasonality\n",
    "occurs when a time series is affected by regularly occuring pattern <br>\n",
    "- every month end or weekend the sales may pickup\n",
    "- higher sales during holiday seasons\n",
    "\n",
    "seasonality is always fixed. whereas cyclicity is becuase of an event or an external event like a business or an economic cycle. typically commodity prices may crash because of the underlying demand in the commodity. <br><br>\n",
    "additive seasonality - magnitude of seasonal fluctuation is almost constant. trend could be positive or negative but the fluctuation in the trend is constant\n",
    "multiplicative seasonality - fluctuation in data or some type of increasing or decreasing pattern in the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Stationary\n",
    "data can be called stationary when the mean and standard deviation is constant and there is no seasonality or trend. <br>\n",
    "the first two conditions of constant mean and standard deviation are very important. <br>\n",
    "we can make the data stationary using some techniques if the third condition is not met.<br>\n",
    "White Noise - when there is no autocorrelation at all <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically when we do time series modelling, the output error serial will be stationary and look like white noise. Such a model is fitted well. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Things to Remeber\n",
    "- Time series can be irregularly spaced\n",
    "- Missing data (cannot do global mean or median. need to smartly impute the data)\n",
    "- Seasonality and Cyclic\n",
    "- Time Series is mostly data analysis"
